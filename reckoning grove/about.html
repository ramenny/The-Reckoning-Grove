        <h1>About This Space</h1>
        <p>This is my personal grove — a quiet, honest place to share thoughts, reflections, and small moments.  
        I write not to explain or perform, but simply to be present.  
        Here, you are welcome to wander, observe, and reflect at your own pace.</p>

        <p>Every page in this grove is a small room. Some are journals, some are logs, and some are spaces for connection.  
        Decorations like lanterns, vines, and fireflies guide the eye gently, without distraction, keeping the focus on calm and clarity.</p>
